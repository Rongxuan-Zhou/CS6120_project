# Research Report Structure and Rubric

## 1. Title Page
- Course Name and Code  
- Assignment Title: "Literature Survey on [Topic]"  
- Group Members' Names and IDs  
- Submission Date  

## 2. Abstract
Brief summary of the report, including the scope, main findings, and key conclusions.

## 3. Introduction
- **Background**: Overview of the chosen topic and its relevance in the field of Machine Learning.  
- **Objective**: Purpose of the literature survey and the specific questions or themes explored.  
- **Scope**: Criteria for paper selection (e.g., publication year, impact factor, etc.).  

## 4. Methodology
- **Search Strategy**: Databases and search engines used (e.g., IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, etc.).  
- **Keywords**: Key terms and phrases used in the search.  
- **Selection Criteria**: Criteria for including or excluding papers (e.g., relevance, publication date, citation count, etc.).  

## 5. Literature Review
### Thematic Analysis:
- Organize papers into subtopics or themes.  
- Discuss key findings and trends within each theme.  
- Highlight how the papers relate to each other (agreements, contradictions, gaps).  

### Comparative Analysis:
- Compare and contrast methodologies, datasets, results, and conclusions across papers.  
- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.  

## 6. Critical Analysis
- **Evaluation of Research Quality**: Assess the validity and reliability of the methods and results.  
- **Identification of Gaps**: Highlight gaps in the current research and potential areas for future investigation.  
- **Implications**: Discuss the practical and theoretical implications of the findings.  
- **Limitations**: Address the limitations of the selected studies and the literature review itself.  

## 7. Conclusion
- **Summary of Findings**: Recap the main points from the literature review and analysis.  
- **Future Directions**: Suggest areas for future research based on identified gaps and trends.  

## 8. References
List all the research papers and other sources cited in the report, following a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE).  

## 9. Appendices (if needed)
Include any supplementary material such as detailed tables, figures, or additional data that supports the analysis.  

## 10. Group Reflection (optional)
Reflect on the group's learning experience, challenges faced, and how the work was distributed among members.
